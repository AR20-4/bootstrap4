# Bootstrap 4

> > Speaker Notes:
Cards are a new design pattern in Bootstrap 4 that help you layout content into card-like containers that look great. There are a ton of options in terms of the classes you can use, so let's take a look.

## <i class="fa fa-list-alt"></i> Basic Card Classes

- `card` container
- `card-body`
- `card-header`
- `card-footer`

> > Speaker Notes:
1. All cards require a container and in order to get things going, you need to add the card class to activate the features. Cards have a mild rounded edge at the top.

## <i class="fa fa-list-alt"></i> Card Images

- `card-img`
- `card-img-top`
- `card-img-bottom`
- `card-img-overlay`

> > Speaker Notes:
1. Images get some special classes. You can use two classes to give images the proper borders. card-img-top gives you an image with round edges at the top.
2. card-img-bottom gives you images with the proper roundness at the bottom. By the way, if you don't want the roundness, you don't use an image class.
3. card-img-overlay is a special class to let you build a card with a background image.

## <i class="fa fa-list-alt"></i> List Groups

- `list-group` container
- `list-group-item`
- `list-group-flush`

> > Speaker Notes:
1. There are a number of classes for specific content like titles, which you can use with headline tags to style card titles
2. You can also use card-subtitle for of course subtitles.
3. Links get their own special links called card-link.



## Conclusion
List groups can be a handy component to use in limited situations, specially for mobile type apps. Bootstrap provides a really comprehensive group of classes to use with this component.
