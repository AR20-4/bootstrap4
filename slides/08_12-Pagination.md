1. Pagination is  a type of navigation, so you should us a nav tag and use the pagination class in the container.
1. Inside that you usually add a list item tag and use a page item. You can also add a disabled class to display the navigation as disabled and an active class to highlight the current page.
1. Inside the element with the page-item class, you add an anchor tag with a page-link class..and that's about it.
