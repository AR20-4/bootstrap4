# Bootstrap 4
Shadows

> > Speaker Notes:
There's a few classes that allow you to add shadows to existing boxes. Note: This won't work for text.

## <i class="fa fas-adjust"></i> Shadows

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">`shadow-none`</li>
	<li class="fragment">`shadow-sm`</li>
	<li class="fragment">`shadow`</li>
	<li class="fragment">`shadow-lg`</li>
</ul>

> > Speaker Notes:
1. There are three shadow sizes and the shadow-none, which removes the shadow. Also interesting to note that if you're really into shadows or they come back like bellbottoms, you can enable more comprehensive shadows using the sass version of bootstrap.

## Demo

## Conclusion
Shadows aren't real popular these days, but sometimes they can really help make something stand out from it's background.
