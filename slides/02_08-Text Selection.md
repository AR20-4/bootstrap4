# Bootstrap 4

Text Selection

> > Speaker Notes:

There's a few classes that change how users interact with the existing text on a site.

<!-- .slide: data-state="hasicon" -->

## <i class="fa fa-font"></i> Text Selection

- `user-select-auto`
- `user-select-all`
- `user-select-none`

> > Speaker Notes:

1. The first option is the default, so the text will behave as normally. It's here just in case you're doing things programatically and need to switch to default behavior
1. The first class, will select the entire element when a user clicks on it.
1. Finally there is a class that creates text that is not selectable by the user.

## Demo

## Conclusion

I like this small addition to the framework. There are certainly times that I want to quickly be able to select some text or prevent users from selecting text at all.
