# Bootstrap 4

> > Speaker Notes:
The Jumbotron is a component for a higlighted section of content that is commonly at the top of many websites. It's really easy to do with Bootstrap

## <i class="fa fa-drivers-license"></i> Jumbotron Classes

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">`jumbotron` container</li>
	<li class="fragment">`jumbotron-fluid` items</li>
	<li class="fragment">Use styles as needed</li>
</ul>

> > Speaker Notes:
1. To create a jumbotron you add a class to main container. It creates a light gray background with slight round edges. 
2. If you add a jumbotron-fluid container, you get a slightly different version that takes up the entire space of the parent.
3. You may have to add a container class if you want the content to obey the grid.

## Demo

## Conclusion
Breadcrumbs are pretty easy to use and style and when you need one, bootstrap gives you just the right classes to take care of them.
